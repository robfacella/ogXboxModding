Relatively easy to use toolkit.

Allowed me to Null out my HDD EEPROM
TEAMASSEMBLY as default pass

Replaced Stock hard drive with an 80GB one using chimp.
Made sure things worked since I was hotswapping while powering the new drive from an entirely different unit's power supply, Sealed up the console and we are sitting pretty.

FTP proved to be interesting.
turns out the console WILL NOT POST if there is no display connected; That is to say, it won't actually load the dashboard.
I couldn't find my crossover cable and there was no way I was carrying my CRT television downstairs just to get the xbox hooked up next to the router.
So I dug up the cheap router I had purchased for my college dorm and by some miracle the LAN ports on it actually worked.  So long as I am willing to knock myself offline, I can run a few ethernet cables and FTP without trouble.

Think I'm going to try to get a Playstation emulator running on it tomorrow.
