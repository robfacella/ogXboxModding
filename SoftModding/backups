Modding an xbox should, in theory, allow one to backup games and play off of the backed up copies whether they are stored internally or reburnt to a disc.
HOWEVER there are numerous limitations in place to prevent potential piracy.

Filesystem architecture of the device prevents files larger than 4gb from existing/running aside from those loaded via the disc drive.
The stock internal HDD is only going to be 10gb and it will be partitioned out.
USB storage cannot be larger than 4GB without BIOS modification, and even then it is limited to USB 1.1 speeds.
Most xbox game image files which i have now seen are between 5.5 and 7GB in size, which would make FTPing only a single game on or off of the stock HDD possible.
The most common consumer use DVDs on the market are only 4.7GB, 8.5gb DO EXIST but they seem to be a bit of a rarity.

I have larger IDE hard drives which I can use, but the drives are meant to be motherboard locked to the consoles and compatability of whatever drives I have sitting around MAY be an issue.
Experimentation to follow.
