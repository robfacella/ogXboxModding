Tools Required:
-An original XBOX (with cables)
-XBOX Controller
-Disc Capable of Running Exploited Save File (I'm using 'Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell')
-Exploit Files <><>
-Small USB Drive Formatted to FAT32
    (When in doubt, Just Let the Console Reformat your Drive)
    {Probably need under a 4GB Flash Drive, know issues with the console's ability to handle larger storage flash drives}
-USB to XBOX Controller Port Adapter (Cheap online || DIY)
