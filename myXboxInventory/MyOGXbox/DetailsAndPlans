The xbox from my childhood, which my brother and I received for Xmas well after the launch date. (Pretty sure the xbox360 was out before we got it.)

Halo Special Edition with the semi-transparent green case.
MFG Date: 2004-02-11

Served us well over the years, I know the clock had been having issues for years SO I assume this model is plagued by the leaky capacitor.
I only plan to remove the broken clock capacitor and leave this model as close to stock as possible.
