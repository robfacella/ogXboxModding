I know that this box has been opened before and have yet to check to identify why.

Hard Modded I believe. Running Evolution X V+393 (EvoX)
  No Game in DVD Drive
  Nothing Seems to be Backed up to HDD
  No Applications/Emulators installed
  Some Trainers for Halo 2 available?

Disc Drive was Sticking, appears to have some sort of grime in the disc tray, will have to clean that.
Power light constantly that yellow/orange color

The console itself is making a high pitched whining noise.

I may just use this one as is IF i can get it online.
