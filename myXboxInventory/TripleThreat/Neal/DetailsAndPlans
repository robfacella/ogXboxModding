Came with a copy of "Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Pandora Tomorrow" in the disc drive.

Clock is also Shot
  Will be removing Capacitor

Power Light Flashes between Orange and Green.... Didn't POST but did after turning Off and On again??
Broken Disc Drive
  It sticks, and was a known issue to Neal. He had tied a string to the tray so that he could pry it open.


  I will see if I can get the disc drive working again before I even bother trying to softmod (I only have 1 exploit disc and cannot afford to lose it inside of a broken DVD drive.)
