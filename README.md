# ogXboxModding
Having collected multiple original XBOX consoles which are gathering dust, I decided that the recent global pandemic is an opportune time to assess the consoles which I own and choose a candidate for soft-modding.

Additionally I will be removing the, potentially/eventually corrosive, stock capacitors from the motherboards of the afflicted consoles.
