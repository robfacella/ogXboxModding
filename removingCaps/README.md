# ogXboxModding

The clock capacitors from early revisions of the OG XBOX have been known to leak and potentially cause damage by corroding the motherboard of the console.

I'm going to be removing them with my soldering kit.
Use a T20 screwdriver to get the case open.

Need a T10 bit to get to the motherboard.
could desolder.... or just wiggle and snap the cap off.
Clock cap removed now wiggle removed from the pre-modded xbox.
Special Halo Edition with clock cap removed.
Both retested and working.

Future Softmod Xbox has its clock capacitor out, tested and working but not resealed because I want to add a larger Hard Drive if possible.
